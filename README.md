# Slick Stacker

Open source firmware and webapp for **photo stacking** on the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers.

## How does this work?



## What do I need to use this?

You'll need:
- a macro rail, driven by a stepper motor
- either an ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller
- a stepper driver (for example A4988, TMC2208, TMC2209, etc.)
- a computer to upload the Slicker Stacker firmware to the microcontroller
- a phone to control the macro rail through the microcontroller

## How do I install Slick Stacker?

1. Buy or build a **Macro Rail** that uses a stepper motor to move the camera back and forth.
1. Hook up the electronics (an ESP8266 or ESP32 plus a stepper driver) to the macro rail.
1. Upload the Slick Stacker firmware to the microcontroller.
1. Upload the webapp to the microcontroller flash storage.
